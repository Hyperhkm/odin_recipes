    <h1><b>How to make Pudim</b></h1>
    <p> It has a wonderful, creamy texture without being too heavy. Melted syrup will run down sides, forming a caramel sauce. 
        <br>Serve cool with a dollop of whipped cream on the side. Top it with toasted coconut and serve with a garnish of tropical fruits such as mango or pineapple.</p>
    <h2><b>Ingredients list</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>4 eggs, separated</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>0.75 cup milk, plus</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><b>Step-by-step</b></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt the sugar in a heavy saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly. Once the sugar becomes a golden brown syrup after about 10 minutes, 
            <br>pour it immediately into a round baking dish, swirling so that the syrup coats all sides of the dish. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Place the egg yolks into a blender and blend on medium for 5 minutes, then add condensed milk, 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk, and egg whites. 
            <br>Continue to blend until all ingredients are combined. Pour egg mixture into the baking dish and cover with aluminum foil. 
            <br>Line a roasting pan with a damp kitchen towel. Place baking dish on towel, inside roasting pan, and place roasting pan on oven rack. 
            <br>Fill roasting pan with boiling water to reach halfway up the sides of the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted 1 inch from the edge comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. 
            <br>The center of the flan will still be soft. Allow flan to cool before unmolding onto a plate. Refrigerate before serving.</li>
    </ol>
